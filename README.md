🆕 I'm trying new things and failing a whole lot along my ways pretty mediocrity

🪦 Tried to help the community with some libraries and packages, more of a learning experience for me (another package for the archives😅)

⌨️ I love my terminal, but stuck in 🪟 right now, but I think my setup is pretty though

🏫 Still learning @[Lakehead-Georgian](https://www.lakeheadgeorgian.ca/programs/computer-science/) for Computer Science  (hope it all pays off)

💞️ Love others as God loves us, and relax it is okay

❔What is the science of computers, no really!?
