## Currently 

Kicking caution to the wind and making things I love (even if it starts off bad :D)\
Like CLI apps - I just love their retro style (for windows cuz that's what I have and there are like none :( )

🌱 Still learning
currently @[Lakehead-Georgian](https://www.lakeheadgeorgian.ca/programs/computer-science/) for Computer Science  (hope it all pays off)

💞️ Some things I love...
  - God
  - Learning
  - Music
  - Programming (duh)


Please tell me where I went wrong or can improve, it'll mean a lot. And hopefully I can fix it
