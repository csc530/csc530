## Currently 

🆕 Trying new things I love or interested in (even if it starts off bad :D)\
⌨️ Like CLI apps - I just love their retro style (for windows cuz that's what I have and there are like none :( )

🌱 Still learning @[Lakehead-Georgian](https://www.lakeheadgeorgian.ca/programs/computer-science/) for Computer Science  (hope it all pays off)

💞️ Some things I love is programming (duh.), helping others, and relaxing😴


❎ Please tell me where I went wrong or how I can improve, it'll mean a lot. And hopefully I can fix it too
