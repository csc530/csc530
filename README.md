# Computer-Scientist

Hi, my name is Christo**f**er and I like helping others and learning, and putting them together is great too :D

I like coding; currently building my programming and deployment skills.

<!-- Since graduating, I've been looking for a job in computer science or where I can at least use some these skills and knowledge I learned from my degree. But the memes were true and my experiences and abilities just don't seem to be enough for these employers. -->
<!-- (like it's been eons since and this is a love letter to family afar off 😂) -->
